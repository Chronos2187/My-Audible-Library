window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author.</b> </p> <p><b>A guide to all kinds of addiction from a star who has struggled with heroin, alcohol, sex, fame, food, and eBay, that will help addicts and their loved ones make the first steps into recovery.</b> </p> <p><i>\"This manual for self-realization comes not from a mountain but from the mud.... My qualification is not that I am better than you but I am worse.\" (Russell Brand)</i> </p> <p>With a rare mix of honesty, humor, and compassion, comedian and movie star Russell Brand mines his own wild story and shares the advice and wisdom he has gained through his 14 years of recovery. Brand speaks to those suffering along the full spectrum of addiction - from drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar addictions to addictions to work, stress, bad relationships, digital media, and fame. Brand understands that addiction can take many shapes and sizes and how the process of staying clean, sane, and unhooked is a daily activity. He believes that the question is not \"why are you addicted?\" but \"what pain is your addiction masking? Why are you running - into the wrong job, the wrong life, the wrong person's arms?\" </p> <p>Russell has been in all the 12-step fellowships going, he's started his own men's group, he's a therapy regular and a practiced yogi - and while he's worked on this material as part of his comedy and previous best sellers, he's never before shared the tools that <i>really</i> took him out of it, that keep him clean and clear. Here he provides not only a recovery plan but an attempt to make sense of the ailing world. </p>";
